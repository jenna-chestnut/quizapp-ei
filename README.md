### DON'T SPACE OUT: A QUIZ APP!

# For this project, we were given a boilerplate html and store structure. We had to use JS to manipulate the DOM using render functions.

For a comprehensive and easy-to-edit code, we utilized several many functions and callbacks to make our app run.

I chose space as my topic because I think it's a fun, universal idea that you can always stand to learn more from.
